# cardetection_and_localization

The algorithm will use convnutional networks to localize and box all the areas where car is present.

It uses yolov2 model to train and localize 80 class objects

Pre trained model and cfg file can be downloaded from--https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/

And it can be converted into keras model from -- https://github.com/allanzelener/YAD2K
